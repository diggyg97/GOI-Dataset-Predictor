# GOI-Dataset-Predictor

This code displays the existing datasets from this link https://data.gov.in/indicator, and if the user desires, they can choose to predict values for the next year.

The Alpha.py is the initial working stage wherein I just began coding.
In the Beta.py stage, I've used functions to make my job a little easier and have added certain Datasets for the Education, Demography & Economy Inidicators.

The 'Datasets' folder contains all the datasets.

Changelog v1.0:
Added Datasets to options 1,2,3 i.e. Education, Demography & Economy.
