# GOI-Dataset-Predictor

This code displays the existing datasets from this link https://data.gov.in/indicator, and if the user desires, they can choose to predict values for the next year.

The Alpha.py is the initial working stage wherein I just began coding.
In the Beta.py stage, I've used functions to make my job a little easier and have added certain Datasets for the Education Inidicator.
